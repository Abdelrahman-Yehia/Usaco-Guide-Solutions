# Usaco-Guide-Solutions
-This is a collection for my solutions in C++ for Usaco Guide problem sets. I didn't solve all the problems on the website but I am working on it and I will update the repository whenever I add up more solutions. These are my own solutions so you might find the ideas different from the solutions on the website and might be simpler as well.
You will find the source code for each problem at the file named main.cpp
